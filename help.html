    <h1>Overview</h1>

    <p>This is a very simple web application that may be useful to
    those managing their electronic logbooks using general purpose
    spreadsheets, databases etc. rather than proprietary commercial
    logbook programs. It takes a simple input format and produces
    comma separated value (CSV) text that can easily be copied and
    pasted wherever desired.</p>

    <p>It can be used manually, but is probably most useful when used
    in conjunction with a program that extracts data from a rostering
    system. A suitable extraction program will soon be made available
    to easyJet pilots.</p>

    <h1>10 minute tutorial</h1>

    <p>This tutorial demonstrates how data can be manually input and
    converted. While this is substantially easier than entering the
    data manually into a spreadsheet or database form, manual input
    remains fairly tedious. A more likely workflow is that data is
    extracted from a rostering system and saved into a file in the
    input format which is then uploaded to be tweaked. The button on
    the left is provided to allow upload of a suitable file.</p>

    <p>For those with access to a suitable rostering system extraction
    program, the tutorial is a familiarisation with the input format
    so that you know how to tweak it. For those without it will
    represent actual workflow.</p>

    <h2>Add a date</h2>

    <p>In the text area, type <code>2016-11-16</code></p>
    <p>This is 16th November 2016 in ISO format.</p>


    <h2>Add an aircraft</h2>

    <p>On the next line down, type <code>G-EZUS:A320</code></p>
    <p>This is the A320 with registration G-EZUS.</p>


    <h2>Add a sector</h2>

    <p>On the next line down, type <code>BRS/GLA 1730/1830</code></p>
    <p>This is a sector from Bristol to Glasgow, off blocks at 17:30z and on blocks at 18:30z.</p>


    <h2>Run the parser</h2>
    <p>You should now have:</p>

    <div class="codeblock">
      <code>2016-11-16</code><br/>
      <code>G-EZUS:A320</code><br/>
      <code>BRS/GLA 1730/1830</code>
    </div>

    <p>Click <strong>Run Parser</strong></p>
    <p>You should see a <strong>Sectors</strong> box open with an entry for the sector:</p>

    <div class="codeblock">
      <code>2016-11-16 17:30:00,  60,   0, "BRS", "GLA", "G-EZUS", "A320", "Self", "p1"</code>
    </div>

    <p>This is the sector in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format, where fields are separated with
    commas and strings enclosed in straight double quotes. CSV format is recognised by spreadsheets,
    so this line can be copied in the browser and pasted into a spreadsheet and the spreadsheet will
    be able to divide it into columns. With Google Sheets, after pasting, a clipboard icon opens
    next to the pasted text with the option <strong>Split text into columns</strong>. This
    functionality is also available via <strong>Data > Split text into columns</strong>. LibreOffice
    Calc and other spreadsheets offer similar functionality.</p>
    <p>The fields are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Off Blocks in ISO Datetime format</li>
      <li>Flight duration in minutes</li>
      <li>Night flying duration in minutes</li>
      <li>Departure airport</li>
      <li>Arrival airport</li>
      <li>Aircraft registration</li>
      <li>Aircraft type</li>
      <li>Captain's name</li>
      <li>Role</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Add the return sector</h2>
    <p>On the next line down, type <code>/ 1900/2000</code>, then re-run the parser. The sectors box
    should now show:</p>

    <div class="codeblock">
      <code>2016-11-16 17:30:00,  60,   0, "BRS", "GLA", "G-EZUS", "A320", "Self", "p1"</code><br/>
      <code>2016-11-16 19:00:00,  60,   0, "GLA", "BRS", "G-EZUS", "A320", "Self", "p1"</code>
    </div>

    <p>If the departure and/or arrival airports are omitted, the departure airport is assumed to be
    the arrival airport of the previous sector, and vice versa. Also note that the date and aircraft
    are carried forward, and that the order of these lines is not important as long as once a sector
    is encountered, a date and an aircraft have been specified.</p>

    <h2>Add an aircraft swap, then an Edinburgh and back</h2>

    <p>On the next lines down, add <code>G-EZOK:A320</code>, <code>/EDI 2030/2130</code> and <code>/ 2200/2300</code>. You
    should now have:</p>

    <div class="codeblock">
      <code>2016-11-16</code><br/>
      <code>G-EZUS:A320</code><br/>
      <code>BRS/GLA 1730/1830</code><br/>
      <code>/ 1900/2000</code><br/>
      <code>G-EZOK:A320</code><br/>
      <code>/EDI 2030/2130</code><br/>
      <code>/ 2200/2300</code>
    </div>

    <p>Running the parser now gives:</p>

    <div class="codeblock">
      <code>2016-11-16 17:30:00,  60,   0, "BRS", "GLA", "G-EZUS", "A320", "Self", "p1"</code><br/>
      <code>2016-11-16 19:00:00,  60,   0, "GLA", "BRS", "G-EZUS", "A320", "Self", "p1"</code><br/>
      <code>2016-11-16 20:30:00,  60,   0, "BRS", "EDI", "G-EZOK", "A320", "Self", "p1"</code><br/>
      <code>2016-11-16 22:00:00,  60,   0, "EDI", "BRS", "G-EZOK", "A320", "Self", "p1"</code>
    </div>


    <h2>Add the duty times</h2>
    <p>On the next line down add <code>1630/2330</code> so that the text area looks like:</p>

    <div class="codeblock">
      <code>2016-11-16</code><br/>
      <code>G-EZUS:A320</code><br/>
      <code>BRS/GLA 1730/1830</code><br/>
      <code>/ 1900/2000</code><br/>
      <code>G-EZOK:A320</code><br/>
      <code>/EDI 2030/2130</code><br/>
      <code>/ 2200/2300</code><br/>
      <code>1630/2330</code>
    </div>

    <p>Running the parser will now open a <strong>Duties</strong> section, with the following
    contents:</p>

    <div class="codeblock">
      <code>2016-11-16 16:30:00, 420</code>
    </div>

    <p>This is the duty start time in ISO Datetime format and the length of the duty in minutes in
    CSV format. Again, this can be copied from the browser and pasted into a spreadsheet and the
    spreadsheet will be able to divide the columns properly.</p>

    <h2>Night flying</h2>
    <p>Let us assume that sectors 2 to 4 inclusive are night flights. Modify the text area by adding
    the night flag, <code>n</code> to sectors 2 to 4 so that it looks like this:</p>

    <div class="codeblock">
      <code>2016-11-16</code><br/>
      <code>G-EZUS:A320</code><br/>
      <code>BRS/GLA 1730/1830</code><br/>
      <code>/ 1900/2000 n</code><br/>
      <code>G-EZOK:A320</code><br/>
      <code>/EDI 2030/2130 n</code><br/>
      <code>/ 2200/2300 n</code><br/>
      <code>1630/2230</code>
    </div>

    <p>Running the parser now gives:</p>

    <div class="codeblock">
      <code>2016-11-16 17:30:00,  60,   0, "BRS", "GLA", "G-EZUS", "A320", "Self", "p1"</code><br/>
      <code>2016-11-16 19:00:00,  60,  60, "GLA", "BRS", "G-EZUS", "A320", "Self", "p1"</code><br/>
      <code>2016-11-16 20:30:00,  60,  60, "BRS", "EDI", "G-EZOK", "A320", "Self", "p1"</code><br/>
      <code>2016-11-16 22:00:00,  60,  60, "EDI", "BRS", "G-EZOK", "A320", "Self", "p1"</code>
    </div>

    <p>Note that the third column now matches the second column for sectors 2 to 4.</p>

    <h2>Not the Captain?</h2>
    <p>If using a rostering system extraction tool, this will be the
    major thing that requires tweaking, since rostering systems do not
    record the per sector role. Above the first sector add
    <code>{CP:Bloggs Jo}</code> and add "p1s" and "p2" flags to the
    sectors so that the text area looks like:</p>

    <div class="codeblock">
      <code>2016-11-16</code><br/>
      <code>G-EZUS:A320</code><br/>
      <code>{CP:Bloggs Jo}</code><br/>
      <code>BRS/GLA 1730/1830 p2</code><br/>
      <code>/ 1900/2000 n p1s</code><br/>
      <code>G-EZOK:A320</code><br/>
      <code>/EDI 2030/2130 n p1s</code><br/>
      <code>/ 2200/2300 n p2</code><br/>
      <code>1630/2230</code>
    </div>

    <p>Running the parser now changes the sectors box to:</p>

    <div class="codeblock">
      <code>2016-11-16 17:30:00,  60,   0, "BRS", "GLA", "G-EZUS", "A320", "Bloggs", "p2"</code><br/>
      <code>2016-11-16 19:00:00,  60,  60, "GLA", "BRS", "G-EZUS", "A320", "Bloggs", "p1s"</code><br/>
      <code>2016-11-16 20:30:00,  60,  60, "BRS", "EDI", "G-EZOK", "A320", "Bloggs", "p1s"</code><br/>
      <code>2016-11-16 22:00:00,  60,  60, "EDI", "BRS", "G-EZOK", "A320", "Bloggs", "p2"</code>
    </div>

    <h2>Other crew members</h2>

    <p>When you declared the Captain in the previous section, a
    <strong>Crew</strong> section will have opened up. This allows you
    to record the rest of the crew on your flight, should you desire
    to do so. In practice it is unlikely that you will want to do this
    unless you have access to a rostering system extraction
    tool. Change <code>{CP:Bloggs}</code> to

    <code>{CP:Bloggs Jo, PU:Smith Jane, FA:Brown Mike, FA:Taylor Liz}</code>

    , so that the text area looks like:</p>

    <div class="codeblock">
      <code>2016-11-16</code><br/>
      <code>G-EZUS:A320</code><br/>
      <code>{CP:Bloggs Jo, PU:Smith Jane, FA:Brown Mike, FA:Taylor Liz}</code><br/>
      <code>BRS/GLA 1730/1830 p2</code><br/>
      <code>/ 1900/2000 n</code><br/>
      <code>G-EZOK:A320</code><br/>
      <code>/EDI 2030/2130 n</code><br/>
      <code>/ 2200/2300 n p2</code><br/>
      <code>1630/2230</code>
    </div>

    <p>Running the parser now changes the <strong>Crew</strong> section to:</p>
    <div class="codeblock">
      <code>2016-11-16 17:30:00, "CP:Bloggs Jo", "PU:Smith Jane", "FA:Brown Mike", "FA:Taylor Liz"</code><br/>
      <code>2016-11-16 19:00:00, "CP:Bloggs Jo", "PU:Smith Jane", "FA:Brown Mike", "FA:Taylor Liz"</code><br/>
      <code>2016-11-16 20:30:00, "CP:Bloggs Jo", "PU:Smith Jane", "FA:Brown Mike", "FA:Taylor Liz"</code><br/>
      <code>2016-11-16 22:00:00, "CP:Bloggs Jo", "PU:Smith Jane", "FA:Brown Mike", "FA:Taylor Liz"</code>
    </div>


    <h2>The spreadsheet</h2>

    <p>This service will most likely be useful to people who already use a spreadsheet of their own
    design for their logbook. If you haven't already created one, I did create a <a
    href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CUrIVIbIr5Xdn3cym0Qdb2giAGUvcMOkp39S_3c51Xs/edit?usp=sharing">
    logbook spreadsheet</a> to test the methodology, which may be a useful starting point. In particular,
    the “Scratch” tab demonstrates how you can easily mould the data to your own designs: paste
    sectors on the left side to get an alternate format on the right.</p>

    <h2>Future-proofing</h2>

    <p>The critical question with respect to logbook data is how to avoid losing
    it. Firstly, it needs to be in a file format that is very widely used in order to minimise the
    danger of loss through software obsolescence. Secondly, it needs to be created with software
    that is very well tested, i.e. it has a very large installed user base. This minimises the
    chance of an undiscovered software bug insidiously corrupting your data. Lastly, it needs to be
    easily transportable, such that you can regularly place copies of the file in diverse locations
    so that no feasible combination of hardware failures can destroy your data.</p>

    <p>My solution is to use a widely used open source database server (<a
    href="https://mariadb.org/">MariaDB</a>) in combination with an overall backup strategy based on
    <a href="http://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable">Borg</a>. This solution is a little complex
    to set up, however.</p>

    <p>Spreadsheets would seem to be a reasonable compromise. They are fairly easy to work with,
    many people already have experience with them, and their installed user base is huge. If you
    use an online spreadsheet such as Google Sheets, you automatically have an off-site backup, so an
    occasional download to your local machine will give you pretty good protection against hardware
    failures.</p>

    <p>The major problem with spreadsheets is that data entry is soul crushingly tedious. The
    purpose of this service is to reduce some of that tedium. It is intentionally not critical that
    the service continues to exist; there will always be the fallback of manual data entry straight
    into the spreadsheet.</p>
